# MongoScrape
Weel 18 In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.


#Installation 

Install mongodb
Start up mongodb ("mongod" Terminal)
"npm install"
"node server.js"
Navigate to localhost:3000 in your Web browser
